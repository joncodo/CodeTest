4 page paths

Attached to this document is a file, paths2.txt

Each line in the file represents a user's browsing history in a website in a single session.

For example:
A user visited page 1, then page 2, then page 1 again, then page 3. The line would be:
p1,p2,p1,p3

A 'path' is defined as a sequence of sequentially visited pages.

Path Examples
p2,p3 	  a "2-page path" consisting of page2 and page3
p1,p2,p3     a “3-page path” consisting of page1, page2, page3
p1,p7,p2,p1  a "4-page path" consisting of page1, page7, page2, and page1

The task at hand is to write ruby code to find the most common 4-page path in paths2.txt.

Example
If the contents of the file are the following:

p1,p2,p3,p2,p3,p2
p2,p3,p2,p3
p7,p4,p2,p3,p2,p3
p2,p3
p1,p3,p2,p3,p2
p2,p3,p2,p5

Then the most common 4-page path is: p2,p3,p2,p3 with 3 occurrences

Bonus questions
What is the most common N page path? (ex: what is the most common 5 page path? The most common 2 page path?)
What are the Y most common N page paths? (ex: what are the top 4 most common 7-page paths)
